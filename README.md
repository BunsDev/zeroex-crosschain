# ZeroEx: The First Cross-Chain Dark Pool

## Introduction

Traders lost approximately $675 million due to MEV tactics alone. But the losses don't end there. Large traders face daily challenges including slippage, MEVs, and adverse price movements as a consequence of large orders being visible and targeted in the market. These issues cumulatively result in billions of dollars in losses, with traders’ strategies often being copied, anticipated, or manipulated.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for ZeroEx came from the pressing need to mitigate these massive, recurrent losses that undermine the integrity and efficacy of digital asset trading. Observing the efficacy of dark pools in traditional finance, where 40-50% of stock trades maintain privacy to avoid market manipulation, we envisioned a similar solution for the cryptocurrency domain.

## Solution

ZeroEx represents a revolutionary step forward: a cross-chain dark pool where trades are invisible to the public eye. By leveraging the technology of Chainlink, ZeroEx facilitates secure, anonymous trading without the risks of MEV or slippage, ensuring that trades are executed quietly and efficiently across multiple blockchain networks.


### Key Features

- **Chainlink Integration**: Utilizes Chainlink for reliable midprice execution and secure cross-chain communication.
- **Dark Pool Mechanism**: Traders can execute orders without exposing their intentions to the market, thus avoiding adverse impacts on pricing.

## Challenges

We already knew about MPC and Homographic Encryption but implementing it was a bit difficult still our team pulled it off and built a great protocol.

## Impact

ZeroEx is poised to radically transform the crypto trading landscape by addressing one of its most critical pain points. It promises to:

1. Save billions of dollars lost to MEV, slippage, and quote fading.
2. Foster deeper, more liquid markets in DeFi.
3. Attract institutional traders seeking secure, private venues.

## Future Directions

ZeroEx is not just a platform for trading existing crypto assets. It is designed to be extensible, with future capabilities including trading futures, options, and leveraging positions.

## Conclusion

ZeroEx is more than just a trading platform—it's a step towards a more robust, efficient, and equitable DeFi ecosystem. Let's build a better DeFi together!
